# Voice-Control-JS
A small game which combines libraries like p5.js and annyang.js to make a simple voice controlled game in a HTML platform
 Hi people, I am Rishikesh
 I am a student with decent enough knowledge on programming specially Javascript. I recently started doing some speech synthesis stuff on js and after learning enough I decided to make a small little game.
Hope you enjoy it


Here is all the information you need to run this program-
1) First of all have an http server on your local machine. I used the node package http-server which can be installed by running the command "npm install -g http-server" 
2) Next run the http server on your machine
3) Open your browser and navigate to your server by typing in the URL section "http://localhost:8080" 
4) Navigate to the path where you have stored the code
5) Click on the asst.html

These are the commands so far - 
1- left
2- right
3- up
4- down
5- stop
