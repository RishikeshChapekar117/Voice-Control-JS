# Voice-Control-JS
A small game which combines libraries like p5.js and annyang.js to make a simple voice controlled game in a HTML platform
 Hi people, I am Rishikesh
 I am a student with decent enough knowledge on programming specially Javascript. I recently started doing some speech synthesis stuff on js and after learning enough I decided to make a small little game.
Hope you enjoy it
